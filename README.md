## 🔍 Who am I?
I'm not just a QA Engineer — I'm a *test whisperer*, and *quality gatekeeper* with 7+ years of experience in functional and non-functional testing, automation frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines. I’ve broken things (intentionally 😄), made them better, and ensured they stayed better. From REST APIs to sleek frontends, I validate it all.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools I Love
- **Languages:** C#, Java(used it long ago) (exploring Python too 🐍)
- **Automation:** Selenium, Playwright, Reqnroll (Cucumber for the BDD win 🥒)
- **API Testing:** RestSharp, Postman
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Frameworks:** NUnit, Cucumber, .NET
- **Others:** Git, Azure DevOps, VS Code, Chrome DevTools

---

## 🧪 My Testing Superpowers
- 👩‍🔬 Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- 🛡️ Building and maintaining regression test packs
- 🤖 Automating UI & API tests
- 🧰 Creating reusable test helpers to make life easier
- 🌀 Switching contexts from manual to automation testing like a pro

---

## 📌 Pinned Projects
Here are a few test automation projects I’ve crafted with care and caffeine:

- 🔹 **[BookStoreAPI Test Framework](https://github.com/pvrano/DemoQABookStoreApiTest)**  
  BDD-style API test framework using RestSharp + Reqnroll + NUnit. Neat, scalable, and reusable.

- 🔹 **[Selenium NUnit UI Test Suite](https://github.com/pvrano/selenium-online-electronic-store-test)**  
  A quick playground for UI test cases on public automation sites.

- 🔹 **[Playwright C# Experiments](https://github.com/pvrano/PlaywrightWithCSharp.git)**  
  Fast and flaky-free UI tests using Playwright + NUnit + Chromium.

> 🔧 *Always experimenting. Always learning. Always shipping quality.*

---

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Deep dive into **Playwright** for modern frontend automation
- Master **Python** and **Pytest** for broader test coverage
- Learn more about **cloud-based QA** and **test observability**
- Exploring **AI-assisted testing** — from LLMs for test case generation to anomaly detection using ML
- Studying **Prompt Engineering** and how it can supercharge QA workflows with tools like ChatGPT and LangChain
- Building mini-experiments on how GenAI can aid in exploratory testing and bug triage
- Creating a knowledge base around **AI x QA** — stay tuned 👀💃

---

## 🦸‍♀️ Fun Facts
- I enjoy debugging flaky tests like solving puzzles 🧩  
- I believe good QA is *empathetic*, *curious*, and *obsessed with detail*  
- I’m a multitasker — from UAT sessions to exploratory testing to scripting automation in one sprint
